					<h1> History </h1>
					<p>
						The history of Makarska dates back to the 4th century. In a document by the Salona Council, a city of Mucrum is mentioned. In the itinerary of the Ravenat, in 7th century, it is mentioned as Aronia id est Mucru.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the middle ages, there was a county of Mocro that was famous by its naval might, and it was a part of the Neretva dukedom. On September 17th, 887 AD, a Venetian doge by the name of Petar Kandijan was defeated in a large naval battle in front of Mokro.
					</p>
					<p>
						The first time the current name, Makarska, is mentioned is around the year of 1502. When the Turks occupied, Makarska was a part of the Primorje province, and had three keeps to guard it. In 1684, Makarska became part of the Venetian republic, and during
						the Venetian hundred-year rule, the city's foundations were built.
					</p>
					<p>
						When Venice fell, Austrians took the throne, imposed the Italianization policy, which made Italian the primary language. Makarska representatives in the Dalmatian assembly fought to introduce the Croatian language for regular use. In 1865, Makarska was
						one of the first to introduce the Croatian language.
					</p>
					<p>
						During WWII, Makarska port served as HQ for Central Adriatic Naval Command. Later, it was moved to Split.
